I found my favorite place to study, <a href="http://www.mozartscoffee.com/">Mozart's Coffee</a>. It's great. Tons of seating inside and out, lots of free parking. I normally sit about 15ft from the water under an overhang. There's normally a light breeze off the somehow very....<stop> cold water to help keep it from getting too warm. I'll try and get a good picture to add to this post when I'm there later today. So, if you're in Austin come by and say hi. I'm here everyday!
