I'm moving to Austin on Sunday for <a href="http://www.themakersquare.com/">MakerSquare</a>. It doesn't start until November 10th, however, I spend most of my days studying web development and Austin seems like the optimal place to study, meet web people..... <stop>, then study some more. 

Is there a more universally loved place than Austin? I feel like people are programmed to say you're going to love it there! Austin is amazing! I'm pretty sure I love Austin too. See you soon!
