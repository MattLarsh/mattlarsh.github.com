Such a great podcast! After I listened to one episode I was addicted. After I listened to ten epidsodes I quit my job and started studying web development full-time. And thanks to Dave Rupert's other podcast <a href="http://atxwebshow.com/"> atxwebshow</a>..... <stop> I heard about <a href="http://themakersquare">MakerSquare</a>, a ten-week web development boot-camp in Austin, TX that I'll be attended in November! Thanks Chris and Dave!
